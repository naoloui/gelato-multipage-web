    <p>
      Gelato which translates to ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù from Italian is a frozen treat from
      Italy which was created in the 16th century. Historians are not sure who
      originally invented it, but the one of the most popular versions of the
      story is Bernardo Buontalenti, a native of Florence, created a form of the
      modern gelato. It's made with milk, sugar, and flavorings like fruit,
      chocolate, or nuts. Unlike ice cream, gelato typically has less air
      incorporated during churning, resulting in a denser product with a silkier
      mouthfeel.
